    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Mayank Divekar, a First Year Computer Engineering student with a passion for building smart solutions through code, creativity, and continuous learning.
      Currently pursuing my degree in MIT AOE, I’ve been diving into areas like software development, web technologies, and system design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant, efficient, and user-friendly applications. Whether I’m working on a class project, a personal build, or exploring the latest in tech, I’m always excited to push boundaries and learn something new.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not coding or exploring new frameworks, you’ll probably find me reading about emerging technologies, building mini projects, or tweaking my setup just for fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the code, I’m someone who values creativity, collaboration, and lifelong learning. I believe engineering is not just about solving technical problems—it’s also about creating solutions that make people’s lives easier, better, or just a bit more fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      This portfolio is a reflection of my journey so far—what I’ve learned, what I’m passionate about, and where I’m headed next.
